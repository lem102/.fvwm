* Tasks

** DONE bind super+up to maximise

*** DONE figure out how to make super a modifier key

Apparently I should look into =xmodmap=.

** TODO emacs maximise command doesn't work after using move window left/right side commands

** TODO 

* What do I want out of fvwm?

- quickly + precisely switch windows
- mouse + keyboard driven
- minimal window decorations
- easily make windows fullscreen
- easily make windows occupy either the left/right side of the screen
- system tray
- time and date
- screenshot
- record screen
- restart lvwm, restart system, logout, shutdown
- a unique aesthetic

** quickly + precisely switch windows
*** keyboard

shortcut for common applications, e.g. Super+1 switches to emacs

what about uncommon applications?

e.g. file browsers, terminals, drawing software

*** mouse

use the taskbar?

can the pager move around or switch windows simply by mousing over them? (run or raise via taskbar)

** launch programs
*** mouse

root window menu, start programs maximised, left side or right side

*** keyboard

for common applications like emacs, can use the keybinding to launch new instances maximised. can have a shortcut to use left/right side of the screen.

** manipulate windows

*** mouse

window buttons for:

- (toggle) maximise
- close
- tile left
- tile right

*** keyboard

shortcuts for:

| key         | action            |
|-------------+-------------------|
| Super+Up    | (toggle) maximise |
| Alt+F4      | close             |
| Super+Left  | tile left         |
| Super+Right | tile right        |

** aesthetic

victorian? celtic?

should be something unique to meeee
